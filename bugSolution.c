The provided code is not inherently buggy; it demonstrates expected pointer behavior.  However, a potential issue might arise if `ptr` were to point to an invalid memory location (e.g., uninitialized or deallocated memory). To make it safer, we can add error checking. This example is not a bug fix, but demonstrates memory safety practices.  

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int x = 10;
  int *ptr = &x;

  //Check if the memory allocation was successful
  if (ptr != NULL) {
    *ptr = 20; 
    printf("%d\n", x); 
  } else {
    fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed!\n");
    return 1; // Indicate an error
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**To make this code truly show a bug and its solution, you would need to introduce an actual problem, such as:**

* **Dangling pointer:** Pointing to memory that has been freed.
* **Memory leak:** Allocating memory dynamically but not freeing it.
* **Incorrect pointer arithmetic:** Accessing memory outside the allocated bounds.
* **Unintialized pointer:** Using a pointer before assigning it a valid memory address.

This improved example addresses memory safety but the original code itself is not inherently 'buggy' in the typical sense of producing unexpected or incorrect results given its constraints.
